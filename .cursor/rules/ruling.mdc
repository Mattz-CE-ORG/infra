## General Rules
- DON'T PUSH TO MASTER WITHOUT PR
- It's 2025, use modern design

## Keyword Rules:
When mentioned in chat
- pr: pull master (stash and pop if needed), stage changes (always `git add .`), create a new branch, commit with message, publish, using gh: make pr target master (include `title`, `head`, and `body` to avoid hitl interaction). Branch name: `fix-...`, `feat-...`, `nv-...`, ... (something that resembles the change); go back to master after process; with proper commit message.
- prp: push a new commit in the same pr
- master: stash, checkout master, pull, pop
- d: git diff | cat
- c: stash, checkout to [branch_name], pop; default to master
- fix [num]: goto master, using gh: get context, fix, pr, close issue with pr number; avoid interactive prompt
- cb: delete all branches except for masters locally
- u/update: move all the stuff that's done to `@today's date` @life.md @work.md. Also sort dates chronologically.
