## Capabilties
- `tf`/`terraform` - CLI tool that grants you access to the terraform cloud and the terraform cli.
- `aws` - aws cli
- `gh` - github cli
- etc

## General Rules
- Your goal is to reach resolution without supervision
- DON'T PUSH TO MASTER WITHOUT PR
- Make sure to everything is working before making a pull request. Consider using your browsing capabiilties to verify.
- Use `docker compose` not `docker-compose` 
- It's 2025, use modern design
- Do not write random readme.md or tests.

## Keyword Rules:
When mentioned in chat
- pr: pull master (stash and pop if needed), stage changes (always `git add .`), create a new branch, commit with message, publish, using gh: make pr target master (include `title`, `head`, and `body` to avoid hitl interaction). Branch name: `fix-...`, `feat-...`, `nv-...`, ... (something that resembles the change); go back to master after process; with proper commit message.
- prp: push a new commit in the same pr
- master: stash, checkout master, pull, pop
- d: git diff | cat
- c: stash, checkout to [branch_name], pop; default to master
- fix [num]: goto master, using gh: get context, fix, pr, close issue with pr number; avoid interactive prompt
- cb: delete all branches except for masters locally
- u/update: move all the stuff that's done to `@today's date` @life.md @work.md. Also sort dates chronologically.
